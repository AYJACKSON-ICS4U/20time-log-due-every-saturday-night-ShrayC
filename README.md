I have learned how to do a 2x2 rubiks cube, mostly memorised but I have to write a couple algorithms down and look at them. I would like to memorise all the algorithms and learn alternate, faster ways of solving the cube.

I've learned how to do a 2x2 rubix cube completley, and I'm trying to learn some of the more complicated methods such as the EG method so I can go faster. I am also trying to apply these algorithms on 3x3 rubix cubes because they do the same thing, so I theoretically should be able to solve most of a 3x3 with the same algorithms.

I can now solve a 3x3 rubix cube easily with the basic method. I used the 2x2 algorithms to solve the first side, the cross on the final side, and the corners on the final side. For the middle layer, I played around with the cube until I figured out how to move the edge pieces into the right locations, and I got help from others to figure out how to solve the final side. I hope to learn more complex and efficient methods for the 2x2 and maybe 3x3 as well in the following week.
