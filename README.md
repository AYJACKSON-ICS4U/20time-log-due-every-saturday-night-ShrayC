I have learned how to do a 2x2 rubiks cube, mostly memorised but I have to write a couple algorithms down and look at them. I would like to memorise all the algorithms and learn alternate, faster ways of solving the cube.
# Saturday, November 4th
I've learned how to do a 2x2 rubix cube completley, and I'm trying to learn some of the more complicated methods such as the EG method so I can go faster. I am also trying to apply these algorithms on 3x3 rubix cubes because they do the same thing, so I theoretically should be able to solve most of a 3x3 with the same algorithms.
# Saturday, November 11th
I can now solve a 3x3 rubix cube easily with the basic method. I used the 2x2 algorithms to solve the first side, the cross on the final side, and the corners on the final side. For the middle layer, I played around with the cube until I figured out how to move the edge pieces into the right locations, and I got help from others to figure out how to solve the final side. I hope to learn more complex and efficient methods for the 2x2 and maybe 3x3 as well in the following week.

I have tried to get faster at doing a 3x3 cube by flicking instead of manually turning the faces. I also use some modified versions of some of the algorithms, such as I have a different algorithm to solve the yellow side in certain cases, and I do the first two layers at the same time. I can now solve a 3x3 cube in 1 min and 20-30 seconds.
# Saturday, November 25th
I have not worked on anything new this week, just practiced 3x3 algorithms and I want to try a 4x4 cube soon or maybe learn other methods such as the X method on the 3x3.
# Saturday, December 9th
I  tried to mess around with the 4x4 and got my friend to help me, I can sometimes solve the middle 4x4 and I know how to line up the pairs around it, then afterwards I can solve it like a 3x3.
# Saturday, December 16th
I continued to practice with the 4x4 and try to master the parts I already know how to do. I also continued to practice the 3x3 and 2x2 to keep improving.
