I have learned how to do a 2x2 rubiks cube, mostly memorised but I have to write a couple algorithms down and look at them. I would like to memorise all the algorithms and learn alternate, faster ways of solving the cube.

I've learned how to do a 2x2 rubix cube completley, and I'm trying to learn some of the more complicated methods such as the EG method so I can go faster. I am also trying to apply these algorithms on 3x3 rubix cubes because they do the same thing, so I theoretically should be able to solve most of a 3x3 with the same algorithms.
